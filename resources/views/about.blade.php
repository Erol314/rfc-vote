## Shaping PHP, together

Thank you for checking out RFC Vote! This project's goal is to visualize how the PHP community feels about the direction that PHP is going. Right now, only internal PHP developers and a select group of people can vote on RFCs — and thus determine the direction of PHP. This website allows everyone from the PHP community to have a voice.

To be clear: community votes won't influence the outcome of PHP RFC votes directly. However, they might give internals a better understanding of what the community wants, and might be a valuable data point in the future.

Besides a vote, people can also share their arguments on every RFC, explaining _why_ they voted yes or no. This way we can learn from each other, and get better insights into why an RFC is popular or not.

## Who's involved?

Many people throughout the PHP community have already [contributed to this project](https://github.com/brendt/rfc-vote/graphs/contributors) — and [you can too](https://github.com/brendt/rfc-vote)!
We also want to give a special shout-out to [Tighten](https://tighten.com/) for helping to create a design.

The initial idea came from [Roman Pronskiy](https://twitter.com/pronskiy), who helps administer the [PHP Foundation](https://thephp.foundation/), and is developed (together with many open source enthousiasts) by [Brent Roose](https://twitter.com/brendt_gd), developer advocate for PHP at JetBrains.
