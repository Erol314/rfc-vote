## How voting works

The goal of this website is to provide a platform for the PHP community to
express their thoughts and feelings about the proposals for the PHP language in an easy way.

While voting is an essential part of expressing how you feel about a potential new PHP feature, it's only _a part_. That's why you must do one of two things if you want to vote:

- Write an argument explaining _why_ you vote yes or no
- Read existing arguments, and vote for those

Every user has three votes they can distribute amongst existing arguments. On top of that, they can write one argument of their own.
All arguments and their votes are counted towards the final result.

You can read more about our goals in the [about page](/about).
